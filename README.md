# Python Code Error: TypeError in Average Calculation
This repository demonstrates a common Python error: `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'`. The error occurs when trying to perform an arithmetic operation (in this case, summation) on a list containing mixed data types (integers and strings).

The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version with input validation to prevent this error.
